## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I got more practice with grid, in particular positioning grid items that span columns and rows. I tried to use css properties more effectively. I learned how to position and resize a background image. I learned grid can be an easy way to set vertical margins on items (I saw Kevin Powell do this in a video recently but I can't remember which one).

### Continued development

Continue practicing all the css.

### Useful resources

- [MDN - Background Position](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position) - This helped me remember the syntax for background position.

- [Kevin Powell's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) - These videos help with just everything when learning CSS.
